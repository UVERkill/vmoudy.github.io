<p>The citizens of Birddale have an event called birdfest each year. During the week, a brutal and bloody combat sport is played. The winners are basked in eternal fame and glory. The losers families are turned into McNuggets.</p>

<a id="high-concept" class="anchor" href="#high-concept" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Game Concept</h3>

<p>Squabble Squad at its core, is a 2D simplification of the lane-based multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), that can be played casually in about 4 minutes. The aim of Squabble Squad is to provide the addictive compelling experience of a MOBA at the casual level, so that it can be enjoyed by everyone, not just the “hardcore” game audience. In order to make the game more accessible, the skilltree and item mechanics have not been included. Skillshot mechanics have been introduced to keep the element of skill in the game, and a series of platform and shield switches have allowed for nascent team strategy. The game takes place on a series of platforms in a side-view 2D plane of view. The platforms are floating in space, much like the game “Super Smash Bros”, and feature two “player only” platforms and one lane where the neutrals spawn.</p>

<h3>
<a id="player-classes" class="anchor" href="#player-classes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Player Classes</h3>

<p>There are a total of 6 classes planned for the initial release of Squabble Squad. All classes are not initially available to the player, and a game must be played with the first class in order to unlock the next class. The first class has no specific strengths and no particular weaknesses to help build familiarity with the subsequent classes. They all vary in movement speed, feather size, and the amount of birdseed required. The birds are also all different sizes.<a href="classes.html"> A complete enumeration of the player classes can be found here.</a></p>

<h3>
<a id="birdseed" class="anchor" href="#birdseed" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bird Seed</h3>

<p>Birdseed is collected each time a neutral is killed. Birdseed is also awarded each time a player is disabled. 1x birdseed is awarded for a neutral kill and 5x for a player disable. When a player is hit with a feather, they become disabled. That means they turn into an egg and roll back to the center of their player platform. Each class has a variable amount of bird seed required to deploy their special class power, depending on their class. When enough birdseed is collected, the class power can be activated by pressing the appropriate button. When the power is activated, the player will be unable to collect additional birdseed for the duration of the power.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
