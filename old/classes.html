<a id="chicken-class" class="anchor" href="#chicken-class" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chicken Class</h3>

<p>The chicken class is the playable class and default class. The chicken is neither the quickest or the slowest, and is intended to fill any role on the team. The chickens class power is an external shield. The shield projects in front of the chicken avatar and is large enough to cover 2 other players. The player is allowed to fire through the shield. It charges up fairly fast.</p>

<h3>
<a id="peacock-class" class="anchor" href="#peacock-class" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Peacock Class</h3>

<p>The Peacock class is the second class that is unlocked. It is unlocked after your first match. The peacocks primary ability shoots a feather that is much wider than the chicken, though it walks much slower. The peacocks class power is team control inversion, meaning the other team's controls are reversed for 10 seconds.</p>

<h3>
<a id="eagle-class" class="anchor" href="#eagle-class" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Eagle Class</h3>

<p>There are a total of 6 classes planned for the initial release of Squabble Squad. All classes are not initially available to the player, and must play a game with the first class in order to unlock the next class. The first class has no specific strengths and no particular weaknesses in order to build familiarity with the subsequent classes. They all vary in movement speed, feather size, and the amount of birdseed required. The birds are also all different sizes.</p>

<h3>
<a id="turkey-class" class="anchor" href="#turkey-class" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Turkey Class</h3>

<p>The Turkey Class is the slowest class in the game. The player's avatar is also the largest, with the largest hit box. However, its primary feather splits into two additional feathers before reaching its target. The turkey’s class power is a controllable super minion that spawns on the middle platform. The turkey enters a state of hibernation when it remotely controls the minion.</p>

<h3>
<a id="flamingo-class" class="anchor" href="#flamingo-class" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flamingo Class</h3>

<p>The Flamingo Class is a support class. While the flamingo is nimble and narrow, it lacks a fast primary attack. As it's special ability it can toss plastic lawn flamingo mines. Up to 4 mines may be planted at one time.</p>

<h3>
<a id="quail-class" class="anchor" href="#quail-class" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quail Class</h3>

<p>The Quail Class is the smallest and most nimble class in the game. It’s primary attack is a tiny feather that is also the fastest. The quails ability grants insane speed that can be a huge benefit for defending a base.</p>
